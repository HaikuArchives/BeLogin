<!-- WHAT -->
<a name="what"></a>
<p><b><font size="4" face="verdana">What is BeLogin?</font></b> <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p><font size="3" face="verdana">BeLogin is an application for limiting access to your BeOS installation.</font></p>

<!-- HOW -->
<a name="how"></a>
<p><b><font size="4" face="verdana">How does BeLogin work?</font></b> <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p><font size="3" face="verdana">BeLogin tries to mimic the login process as seen in Windows or Un*x (and others).<br>
BeLogin works by making certain that no program (besides those specified) will be run until a correct <br>
username and password combination has been entered.<br>
When BeLogin is launched it will bring down the applications which are specified in its <b>Blocked</b> list (usually <br>
Deskbar, Tracker and Terminal). BeLogin will then displays its Login window. While this Login window is shown<br>
all application launches are terminated, unless they have been explicitely specified in BeLogins <b>Runnable</b> list<br>
When a correct username/password combination has been entered BeLogin shuts down, and executes a script. This script<br>
should contain the applications that needs to be executed upon a valid login (usually Deskbar and Tracker).
</font></p>

<!-- CAVEATS -->
<a name="caveats"></a>
<p><b><font size="4" face="verdana">BeLogin caveats</font></b> <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p><font size="3" face="verdana">An ordinary Login program, would block all programs at bootup (before any programs are run at all)<br> 
but that would have to be supported at kernel-level (read: Be needs to implement it).<br>
BeLogin does not set the user logged in - this is being looked into, but depending on some factors might not be <br>
included (a lot of programs are not aware of multiple users). <br>
BeLogin uses the methods supplied by BeOS to detect application launches. These methods only tell when an ordinary<br>
application is launched and not any of the supplied commandline applications.</font></p><br>

<!-- REQUIREMENTS -->
<a name="req"></a>
<p><b><font size="4" face="verdana">System Requirements</font></b> <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p><font size="3" face="verdana">BeLogin requires BeOS Release 5 as a minimum. It has only been tested on this version.<br>
This release of BeLogin only includes a binary for Intel x86 and compatible processors. It should compile on PPC though.</font></p>

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
<a name="installation"></a>
<p><b><font size="4" face="verdana">Installation instructions</font></b> <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p><font size="3" face="verdana">
1. Extract the BeLogin zip file into your application directory (usually /apps/)<br>
2. Run the BeLoginSettings program to setup Belogin. Use "Administrator" as password (do change the password)<br>
3. Add BeLogin to your BootScript (located in /boot/home/config/boot/)<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ie. <i>/boot/apps/BeLogin/bin/x86/BeLogin &</i><br>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;note: If you have other applications in you bootscript (ie. Pulse) either add the to BeLogins bootscript or add them to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the <b>Runnable</b> list. (In the case of Pulse, this would be irrelevant since the Deskbar is shutdown).</i><br><br>
4. Restart BeOS to see that it is actually working! As you will propably notice both Deskbar and Tracker is launched<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which could enable a fast user to do unwanted stuff. To stop this from happening you need to edit the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;system bootscript (/boot/beos/system/boot/Bootscript). You need to stop the execution of Tracker, the Deskbar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and/or Terminal. Scroll 3/5 down and find the following lines:
<pre><i><font color="#666666" face="verdana">
if launch beos/system/Tracker	# start the Tracker
then
	launch beos/apps/Terminal	# no Tracker? try Terminal
fi

sleep 1

launch beos/system/Deskbar		# launch DeskBar
</font></i></pre>
and add a # before each line, thus becoming:
<pre><i><font color="#666666" face="verdana">
#if launch beos/system/Tracker	# start the Tracker
#then
#	launch beos/apps/Terminal	# no Tracker? try Terminal
#fi
#
#sleep 1
#
#launch beos/system/Deskbar		# launch DeskBar
</font></i></pre>
5. Done! That wasn't so hard was it? (if you actually think it was, please write me since I would really like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to know if people find the installation of BeLogin tricky)
</font></p>

<!-- ADDITIONAL -->
<a name="additional"></a>
<p><b><font size="4" face="verdana">Additional information</font></b> <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p><font size="3" face="verdana">
BeLogin adds two new sound events to your system (Valid Login, Invalid Login). These may be removed with the <br>
Remove sound events script<br>
Belogin has NO backdoors. If you loose you password you can bypass BeLogin, by installing another version<br>
of BeOS and booting that to remove BeLogin from the System Bootscript.<br>
Yes... The icon is awfull - please send a better :) .<br>
BeLogin is distributed under the Gnu General Public License, which is included in the package.

<!-- BELOGINSETTINGS -->

<p><b><font size="4" face="verdana">Using BeLoginSettings</font></b> <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p><font size="3" face="verdana">
The user section should be relatively self explanitory (Mail me if you don't think so).<br>
The <b>Blocked</b> and <b>Runnable</b> views is quite simple to use. Just drag any application into <br>
the list and they will be added.<br>
You can also type in your own mime type for an application. If you press the add button while not having<br>
modified the mimetype line, an "Open file" panel will be shown. Double click an application in the list to remove<br>
it.<br>

Ver 1.4.0
change: Enhanced UI - suggestion by Carlos Hasan  [Brian Matzon]
fix:    Fixed potential security bug, where a user could (if access is already gained) add a user to BeLoginSettings. Please note 
        that IF a user somehow gets access to you computer while it's logged in, BeLogin can *easialy* be circumvented. [Brian Matzon]
fix:    Fixed small bug in login procedure, where an empty username would crash BeLogin/BeLoginSettings (Duh!) [Brian Matzon]
change: Instead of using a bitmap for logo, we now use a PNG image, which reduces size considerably [Brian Matzon]

Ver 1.3.2
fix:    Fixed a small bug where editing a user or adding a new user compared the two passwords
        case insensitive - by Brian Matzon [brian@matzon.dk]
change: Algorithm used to save the password has been changed to a more secure (MD5) - by Brian Matzon [brian@matzon.dk]
change: Changed the application vendor tag from Matzon to BeLogin - by Brian Matzon [brian@matzon.dk]
change: Changed the settings directory from ~/config/Matzon/BeLogin to ~/config/BeLogin - by Brian Matzon [brian@matzon.dk]

Ver 1.3.1
fix:    Notification of invalid logins is now done asynchronously. (Previously one could open 
        the Team Monitor during the long pause) - by Vitaliy Mikitchenko [vitviper@bemail.org]
change: BeLogin is now distributed under the Gnu General Public License


Ver 1.3
change: BeLogin (and BeLoginSettings) is now distributed with source. I do not have the time
        to continue development of BeLogin and will therefore release it to the public.
        Since the (simple) encryption rutine is visible in the source, expect some lamer
        to relase a small proggy to crack passwords.
        I would like to keep BeLogin on my site, and not have millions of clones around to annoy
        the end user. I therefore hope that any modifications to the code is submitted back to
        me (credits will be given!).

Ver 1.2
add:	The Screensaver is now allowed to run as default (or technically the SceenBlanker)
add:	The username is now passed as an argument to the login script. (i.e. alert $1)
fix:    Fixed a silly bug, that said 'Program is allowed to run' when a program on the  
        Runnable list was executed Duh!

Ver 1.1
add: 	I have reenabled the Team Monitor quitting. Many thanks to Dianne Kyra Hackborn
	for the needed info.
fix:	Better readme/documentation.
info:	I have decided that it is time to take BeLogin and BeLoginSettings out of beta.
	I have only had complaints about the Team Monitor rutines, which I too found buggy.

Ver 1.0.3b
rem:	I have removed the termination of the Team Monitor, since it is *VERY* buggy.
	I will try and fix it as soon as possible but since it is a hack I cannot guarentee
	that I will get it up and running again..,
fix:	While debugging I turned of the termination of applications on the Blocked list.
	This has been reenabled.

Ver 1.0.2b
add:	BeLogin now terminates the Team Monitor. Due to some technicalities pressing
	CTRL + ALT + DEL the second time, causes BeOS to reboot.
add:	BeLogin now sleeps for Attempts^2 seconds for every invalid login.

Ver 1.0.1b
fix:	BeLoginSettings now traverses Symlinks 
add:	BeLoginSettings now accepts multiple dropped/selected files.

Ver. 1.0b
*Puff*
